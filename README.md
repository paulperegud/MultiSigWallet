Ethereum Multisignature Wallet
===================

Since Gnosis has deprecated their multisig wallet, this repo retains only the frontend (dApp) for interaction with existing multisig deployments. The dapp has been deployed to legacy-multisigwallet.eth. Apart from that, minimal amount of changes has been made: restyling (css), and adding a Dockerfile. Please examine them yourself before using the dApp.

Purpose
-------------
The purpose of multisig wallets is to increase security by requiring multiple parties to agree on transactions before execution. Transactions can be executed only when confirmed by a predefined number of owners. A web user interface can be found [here](/dapp).

FAQ

### How to set a custom Ethereum Node?
You can specify a custom Ethereum Node endpoint by going to `settings` page. Click on `Ethereum Node` dropdown menu and select `Custom configuration`, this would make the Ethereum node's field editable. Please write your new endpoint there. Remember, if `Web3 Provider` is set to `Default (Metamask, Mist, Parity)`, Multisig will use the Ethereum Node endpoint coming with the Web3 Provider, so in that case go to your injected Web3 Provider (Metamask for instance) and update/switch your Ethereum Node endpoint.

### I've imported a Multisig address or a contract address into address book but it gets detected as a EOA
Make sure you're connected to the same network your Multisig/contract was created on, if you created it on Mainnet, you should then connect to Mainnet in order to let the system detect its type correctly.
